# Welcome to My Personal Site!

I'm a senior software developer currently building web applications in Madison! I figured that I needed a place to dump my insanity every now and again, as well as share my professional and personal ideals. Abandon hope, all ye who enter here, because beyond this point you will find my unabashed opinion on development, food, gaming, maybe some history and *gasp* politics!

As I've made this process a lot easier for me to write my posts, I'm hoping to have posts for you at least weekly, if not more often than that. Who knows, maybe you'll leave some writing for me every once in a while in the comments!
