# Obviously, Start With the How

So about 6 months ago, I hit 307 pounds. Again. Which, by the way, is incredibly unhealthy, especially when your family has issues with Diabetes. My self esteem, motivation and energy were pretty much non-existent, and I hated the way that I looked. I was so sick and tired of being out of shape. I couldn't allow that to continue. So when one of my friends referred me to Anytime Fitness, I knew that it was about time that I start working out again. I signed up for personal training, team training and a gym membership, and began tracking my caloric intake, as well as other macros like protein, fat and carbs.

# And Now, the Why

6 months later, I now weigh 288 pounds and I have lost several inches in several measurements. I have become several times stronger in many areas, and have much more motivation and energy. I do not see myself stopping or quitting anytime soon. Why is this? Because of a few key concepts that I have put into effect in my life pretty much accidentally. However, with the help of an excellent book and with a healthy dose of hindsight, I have figured these out, and now I'm going to tell you all how to keep yourself motivated, as you work toward your goals (whether they are weight loss, opening a brewery or what have you).

## Concept One: Make Manageable Changes

So in the past, whenever I tried to get into shape, I had always made the same mistake: I either tried to change too much all at once, or I didn't really change much at all. It was never an hour of working out 3-4 times a week, it was crossfit once or twice a week or trying to accomplsh 300 situps in one afternoon. It was ridiculous, and unsustainable. While I was seeing results during the crossfit months, most of that came from my crash diet, which caused me eventually to spiral out of control since I was denying myself the things that I used to love. Here's something about the human mind that you should already know: denying it anything makes that thing about a hundred times more desirable and 'necessary'. Which, again, was not at all sustainable.

So then, how did I manage to make my current plan more manageable and sustainable? I increased the number of times I worked out within a week to a number that would not discourage or exhaust me, while tracking my calories and still eating the things that I loved. By cutting out various calorie traps like cheese, dense sauces or extra patties and bacon, I was able to have a Five Guys burger and fries sparingly and keep it under 800ish calories. Best part? It is still delicious and I don't forbid myself from having it, keeping it from becoming an impossible temptation to ignore.

In order to maintain a goal, make it manageable. Don't try to kill yourself with todos, diets, action items, whatever. Instead, set up a manageable plan for your goal. Maybe blog once a week in order to blog more often without cutting out of leisure time, or replace an hour of TV with reading up on a subject that you feel will help you attain your goal. Just remember to do _something_, without making you feel like you have sacrificed your entire life to the goal. Why's that an issue? Because regret is a powerful demotivator.

## Concept Two: Dealing with Regret

Recently, I was having to choose between my personal life and working out. I used to have team training from 6-7 on Mondays and Wednesdays, but guess what happens at those times? Life. Life happens. So I found myself cancelling here and there because I felt that I needed to take an opportunity to attend an event or spend time with my friends. I regretted not working out, but I knew that I would regret missing any opportunities. You see, regret is a powerful demotivator. It asks you "Why are you working out and missing out on spending time with your friends? Why are you skipping an event that could help your career just to burn like 300 calories? Are you crazy?" The answer, of course, is no, but in the moment, it never seems to be quite the same.

As a result, I switched to morning team training courses, and I even added a day, cementing my fourth workout within the week. Why? Because while I regretted missing out on some opportunities, I knew that I would regret gaining weight back even more. You see, dealing with regret by using your fear of future regret fuel you will help you to remember why 1,2,3 or even 500 calories burned is not something that you want to skip out on. So, when you are seeking your goal, whether in weight loss or what have you, think ahead to the future. Do you want to be sitting there regretting another year passed that you haven't pursued your goal? Or do you want to look back on a year well spent without any regrets, having moved closer to your goal?

## Concept Three: Moving Incrementally

A few weeks back I finished my copy of "The Compound Effect", which I feel was an excellent book, by the way, and I highly recommend it, and I realized that the base idea was so true. Just like money within a Roth IRA, our lives are made of decisions that compound their effects on our lives over time. Looking back, I realized that all of those times that I tinkered with computers, taught myself to program, worked towards my degree and so on and so forth, I was incrementally moving towards my goal of a career as a software engineer. In the same fashion, in the last 6 months, by eating about 500-1000 calories less a day, and working out 3 times a week, thus losing only a pound or a pound and a half each week, I have been incrementally moving towards my goal.

This one kind of goes hand in hand with concept one, since this is one of the reasons that keeping things manageable will help you to reach your goal. Will it take longer? Yes. Will you be likely to drop out from exhaustion or regret? No. It only takes small, positive and most importantly _consistent_ decisions over time that will move you incrementally towards success. That was a huge lesson from "The Compound Effect", one that I think has positively altered the course of my life. Again, I highly recommend that book; it may not be perfect and there are parts where I didn't fully agree with him, but all in all, I know that I walked away from that book in a much more positive direction in my life.

## Concept Four: Maintaining Motivation

This one is a bit tough, and again, this one came from the book "The Compound Effect" (actually, a good share of this blog post may have, but hey, I never claimed to be a self-made success guru!), but the concept here is that you need to answer _why_ you chose this goal, and then remember your answer. Make sure that your answer will continue to motivate you as it did when you first decided to pursue your goal. Are you trying to lose weight in order to ensure that you do not have a higher risk for heart disease? Remember that. Or maybe it was that you wanted to hike more often to take pictures in nature, and your weight kept you from doing so. Remember that. Maybe you wanted to learn more about physics in order to develop your own game. Remember that. No matter what your goal, answer the _why_ and remember it, since there will come plenty of times that you are tempted to give up and will need a little extra motivation in order to accomplish your goal.

## Conclusion of This Post (But Not My Workouts!)

I've seen so many how-to's on losing weight that have ultimately led people astray. They start strong, feel great for accomplishing a little bit, and then suddenly they're back in a rut. That's why I didn't want to focus on the _how_ I lost weight, but rather the _why_. It's the _why_ that is most important; yes, exercising several times a week and tracking caloric intake are important (and really the only healthy way to lose weight, although there are some diets like Weight Watchers that are equally healthy since they're basically tracking caloric intake too), but these alone will not help you. You need to make good consistent decisions, in a manageable fashion. You need to use regret as a motivator, rather than a demotivator and you need to remember _why_ you chose your goal in the first place. This post was not really about losing weight, but more about how you can start working towards any of your goals. I know that in the future, I will be using what I have learned from my weight loss journey, as well as "The Compound Effect" and various other media, to ensure that when I set my mind on something, I will accomplish it. I hope you accomplish your goals as well. Unless you're a mad scientist bent on world domination. Then disregard everything I have said in this post.

Have a great last few minutes of your Sunday!
