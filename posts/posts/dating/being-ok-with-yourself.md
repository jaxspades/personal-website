# An Apology

I know I've been rather silent this month, and I want to apologize about that. I wanted to get a post out each week, and I've been both busy and lazy. Between moving, having to replace my vehicle, and transitioning into a new role at work, I've sort of become a bit lax on my blog duties. Hopefully, I will be able to blog much more often in the future, now that I have laundry time to blog! In fact, as I'm writing this, I'm at the laundromat (the laundry room at my apartment is usually busy and I like having the time to blog or work on personal projects) while Teen Mom 2 is playing. Last week it was Full House...too bad for this week. Anyways, I think that I will be much more dedicated to my blogging from here on out!

# That Harsh Realization

I've been working a lot on myself lately. For years, I have been unhappy and for the longest time, I kept blaming it on anything and everything else but myself. It doesn't mean that everything was my fault; but I spent so much time focussing on the external locus of control, rather than how I could be responsible for my life moving forward, that I took things out on those around me. I was selfish; I was an asshole; I said things that I had to apologize for the next day when I was nursing a hangover...I just wasn't doing all that well.

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't like EVERYTHING in my life was terrible; there were so many things in my life that were going well. I graduated from college. I had my first job as a software engineer. I made a lot of incredible friends. I started climbing out of debt. I got a new job. I even got promoted a few times; yet for some reason, my brain and heart were laser focussed on my relationship issues and I was moody. I found myself suddenly coming to the harsh realization that I'm just not working on myself as hard as I should be. I'm not developing myself and taking care of myself and as a result, I've been unhealthy.

I kept focussing on things that went wrong, and kept looking for some daydreamed idea or notion of a relationship, that I just stopped trying to love myself or being happy with myself. I stopped being thankful for everything amazing that I have.

# How It Hit Me (Have a Little Help From My Friends)

I was slipping slowly into my drunk and moody alter ego, Moose. I was complaining about something, something about dating or relationships not working out or whatever. It didn't matter. I was bitching about nothing, plain and simple. I had this great group of friends sitting around and hanging out with me, and I'm upset that I'm "alone". Over the next few days, I notice that I keep checking my phone. I'm always somewhere else, always looking for something else, and that's entirely unfair to my friends and family.

I had never noticed until two of my best friends kept in my face (as they should have) about the fact that I'm blessed to have friends with me and that I'm focussing on what I don't have instead of being thankful for what I do have. On top of that, I've been reading The Miracle Morning (a book suggested by my best friend, who yes, was one of the two hitting me with the hard truth), which had some more information for me: *You will never be more successful than your own level of personal development* (paraphrased from memory). It also drove home the importance of being thankful and grateful. It drove home the importance of taking care of yourself. It drove home the importance of being OK with who you are -- not in a way where you become complacement; but rather embracing who you are as a person and investing in yourself. All of this means that if you want to pull yourself out of the dirt, you cannot blame others. You cannot focus on what you are missing and what you do not have. You have to do everything in your power to take responsibility for your life and build yourself up. To be thankful for what you have and who loves and cares for you, even when you're focussing on what is unimportant. You have to be happy with yourself.

I'm thankful that I have such amazing friends and family. I'm thankful that I have a job doing what I love. I'm thankful that the company I work for has been investing in me. I'm thankful for my new car and that I was able to purchase one after rebuilding my terrible credit. I'm thankful that I realized that I have work to do and that while I'm a work in progress, I am happier with myself than I was even a few days ago.

This may seem like it should be in my motivation category; maybe. I decided to place this into dating because this is so core to a problem I have had: I have ALWAYS had one or more crushes at any given time, except the one time I was in a relationship. Otherwise, I've had a crush. I've daydreamed and internalized how my interactions would go and it would be perfect and blah blah blah. Not anymore. No, that's all fake and means nothing. It builds nothing except deep, unrequited, and foolish feelings. Now, I date myself for a while. I have a crush on myself for a while. I internalize how I should be, and how I should interact with friends and family. I build deep, requited, and wise feelings for myself and my friends and family. That's why I put this into the dating category.

I hope that you can find what you are grateful for, and that you can be happy with yourself, even if you are a work in progress. I hope that you go date yourself. :)

Now if you will excuse me...I have work to do to get out of my own dog house. :D
