# Happy Cinco de Mayo

First and foremost, happy Cinco de Mayo. You've made it, another year to a time where you aren't shamed for  having margaritas for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Hey, it's a holiday today, and we celebrate holidays with panache! Meanwhile, at this time, I am sitting on my balcony, using my laptop as it was intended to be  used (bringing my addictions to the outdoors), and drinking Goose Island's Summertime Koelsch. While, yes, that appears to be spelled incorrectly, here's a little known fact. The umlaut (two little dots above u, a, or o in German) in Kolsch is really hard to type on the editor I am using. Luckily, the easily printable and typable yet perfectly valid version is to simply use an 'e' after the letter with an umlaut. Boom, one paragraph in and you learned something mostly useless already. Hey, I have a quota to fill after all.

Anyways, I'm drinking their delicious Koelsch. You hear that Goose Island? You did well and I talked about it...I'm perfectly fine with doing more product placement if you want to send beer or my own brewery seed money my way...

Oh...right...I'm here on a mission. A mission to tell you about dating, but not in a sappy, romantic way (although romance is awesome and underrated), nor in a "fuck the world and all of those who burned me" way, but in an "Oh my gawwwwd, I have NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING HAAAAALLLLLPPPPPP!!!!! THIS IS SO AWKWARD AND WIERD!!!!!!" kind of way. I think I will blog about this at least more than once, so I've made this one of the categories on my site. No, you can't see categories or tags or what have yous yet, I'm still working on implementing that, and reading, and dating, and working, and gaming, and...you get the point. Soon. Soon it will be here and it will be awesome. But for now, you get to read my awkward ramblings.

# I'm Clearly Not The Expert

So I want to start this whole dating category thing off with a disclaimer: "I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM DOING!". This article will be linked in each of my dating posts because I don't want to argue with people about dating. This is not me saying "Do this" or "Do that" or "men/women/humans/whatever sucks". These are just my stories and musings about dating. If you don't like it, that's fine. I'm not here to make you happy, you have to do that yourself. I'm almost 30 and that's the most incredible and freeing thing I have ever learned. But, I do _want_ to entertain people, it's a core problem with my somewhat intro-extraverted self...which brings me back to me talking about dating.

Dating is weird and awkward because I MYSELF am weird and awkward. Honestly, talk to me, or just read my blog. I'm ridiculous and I know it, and while there are times that I know I'm an awesome individual and that I love who I am as a weird, geeky creature, I sometimes am self conscious and guess how it comes out? With me being incredibly awkward. Mix that in with a heaping helping of "LOL I'M CLUELESS" and "WUT? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING" and you have the makings for some pretty interesting dating adventures if I do say so myself.

# Dating History

So here comes that part where I throw down some credentials, which at this point looks like a certificate for eating the most wings at a sports bar, half of a Snickers and about 40 tickets from an arcade: I have had only one official girlfriend, and a few other girls that I have casually dated, and a few other encounters. I am mostly going to avoid talking about any of them because I don't want to drag their names all over town. Some of my musings will come from the things I have learned through these experiences, but there will be no identifying information. If there is, it is ONLY because I spoke with them first and foremost about it, and I highly doubt that this will come up. But, like I said, my credentials aren't inCREDible. Yeah. I'm terrible at puns. Don't care. Like I was saying, I'm no expert, but I have a lot that I want to say because I feel compelled to share my beer-adled brain thoughts with this inter-world of nets.

# I'm Not Perfect

I know I have ghosted (stop contacting them and let the relationship whither away until there is no more contact). I've been a dick. I used to have a much more sexist view of the world, especially when I was younger and much more naive and stupid. I know I'm not perfect, and I think these posts will be a way for me to get my thoughts out there and maybe reflect on how I can be less idiotic when it comes to dating. Because, at the end of the day, I think that's what we all hope for as we date. Unless you have a significant other, then you're just hoping to find the best netflix show to go with all that pizza you just ordered...which sounds like a pretty awesome plan. As for me? I'm going to continue blogging and being baffled for the time being. Boo....my Koelsch is gone...anyways, Happy Netflix and Pizzaing people!
