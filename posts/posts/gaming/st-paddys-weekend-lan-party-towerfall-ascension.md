# The LAN Continues

Alright, I've already told you about how the LAN kind of got going, as accurate or inaccurate as that may be (you'll never know!! MWAHAHA!!!), and told you about an incredible party game of cartoony violence, called Gang Beasts. Now, I'm going to explain another incredible cartoony and violent multiplayer battle royale kind of game, Towerfall Ascension.

## The Gameplay

Every single character is an archer. There are no classes, you are all archers. So, the differences in gameplay come about based on how many (or how few) arrows you have, and of what type. The game is a 2D platformer battle royale, like Bomberman or the original Mario Bros. battles. You each start in your own little area, and can jump around or move around the map. You can duck in order to hide (works best if the map goes dark due to a power up), jump, or slide/dash/dodge. The last one is pretty much the same mechanic, and all use the same button, but work differently depending on whether you are jumping, ducking or moving. You can also shoot arrows, or crush someone by having your feet touch their head (jumping/falling onto them, or even just dodging past their head).

If you slide/dash/dodge, you can catch arrows shot at you, so that you don't die (always good). You either want the most kills, or to be the last person standing, if you're in competitive mode (depending on game mode). If you're playing cooperative mode, you want to kill the baddies. So, you want to dodge a lot, because not dying is important (always). There are also level hazards, like blocks that slam around (and will crush you) or blocks that appear or disappear.

Lastly, there are power ups, which are used to either give you a one-hit shield (one hit will normally kill you), making the level dark, having a bomb go off, having level impede onto the level, or by giving you awesome arrows, like ones that drill through a single wall (they normally stick into a wall so that you or others can retrieve them; drill arrows will go through one and then stick into the next), ones that explode, ones that create killer bramble bushes, and ones that will change direction in the air at 90 degree turns to find a target (lightning arrows).

The gameplay is fast paced and full of death, and is incredibly fun and competitive. I used to hate such games (as I was bad at first person shooters, and thought competitive games were all like that), but this game is so hilarious and fun that it is impossible to hate it.

## The Characters

All of them are the same, except in appearance. You have about 4 choices in the core game and like 10 more in the expansion.

## The Environments

There are too many to list off here in great detail, but everything is well crafted for a lot of fun, and each have their own power ups, hazards and style. The entire game is rendered in beautiful 2D pixel art. Mmmmmmm....

# The Wrap Up (For Part 2)
All in all, I feel that this game is well worth $15 for being an indie game. It is immensely fun for local multiplayer (be forewarned it does not have internet multiplayer at this time), and if you shell out an extra $10, you get more power ups, more levels, more baddies, more characters and a level editor with the capability to download community crafted levels! FUN! If you love Spelunky's multiplayer, or even Bomberman/Mario battles, check this one out. In fact, check it out either way.

Have a great Monday!
