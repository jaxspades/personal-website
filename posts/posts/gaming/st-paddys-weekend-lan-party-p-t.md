Hey all, in my third and final post about this past weekend's LAN party, I will be writing about probably the most frightening thing that has happened to me in a long time: I played a horror game for about 5 minutes. The game? PT.

# PT

So PT (short for Playable Teaser), is a short yet complete horror puzzle game that is a trailer for an entirely different project.


I'm going to go into details here so SPOILER ALERT.

You can't get this game on the Playstation Network anymore, so I'm not spoiling too much here.

Anyways, the game starts with you in a dark room, and a cockroach flitters across the floor. The door cracks open, and in the crack, we see a humanoid shape peering at us, before disappearing into the darkness. Yeah. Already, I hate this. Cockroaches? Creepy person opening a door to what appears to be my prison cell? How about I just open up a big ole can of Nope Tuna?

Knowing that I hate horror anything (though I will read the occasional Stephen King novel or watch suspense/thrillers and Netflix's Hemlock Grove because I'm a walking contradiction), the other LAN partiers egged me on to continue through the now open door. I slowly but surely make my way out of the room and into a dimly lit hallway in a basic suburban house. It's not new, but I can't quite make out during which defade this house was built, or in which time period I find myself. I slowly continue down the hallway, until I hear a radio talking about a local who murdered his entire family. Joy. I continue through the house, only able to remain in an 'L' shaped hallway that leads from one door, past two alcoves full of decorations and stuff, past some mystery door, and onward through the two story foyer, down a few steps toward a basement door, and through the door only to appear _right back at the other end of the hallway_. Thanks, house.

Next, I make my way to the mystery door. You have basically two options here. You can move, and you can zoom in, kind of like in a point and click adventure. I zoom in, looking at the now slightly open door, when a ghastly female visage snears at me from the darkness and slams the door. Screaming like a 4 year old whose just been told they were being sold to the gypsies for their bad behavior (thanks Mom and Dad), I move the character at a glacial pace away because _of course_ you can't run in this game. I immediately decide that this game isn't for me and hand the controller over to the next person. I lasted maaaaaaaayyyyybbbbeeeeeee 3-5 minutes, before almost having a nervous breakdown. I was completely out of breath from trying not to breathe heavily and make sounds (because of _course_ whatever is in the house can hear me), and was sweating as if I had just gotten back from a stint of hot yoga.

Yet I stayed, to watch the cursed tale unfold, as the next victim (gamer) played on. Here's the highlight reel:

You eventually find out that the mystery room is a bathroom, which has some sort of twisted, creepy dead infant in the sink, and blood all over the bathroom. You hear weird noises, have a chandelier crash only to look up at the second story and see the female ghost watching with her head tilted like a puppy trying to understand the larger world around it and OH MY GOD SHE'S SMILING. SHE'S SMILING AND I WANT TO RUN BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS IS HOW I DIE.

You piece together a story. Eventually, you realize that you've been stuck in this house for days, maybe months, and maybe even years, stuck in a gruesome groundhog's day time loop where instead of learning the piano, you have to face the horror that you are the local who killed his family. Your wife had a baby with her boss, and you killed her and it in a fit of alcoholic and jealous rage. You are faced with a few of the gruesome ways that you killed your family and that you are now haunted by your wife and are paying the price for your sin. When you finally figure out the entire puzzle, the game stops and it shows Norman F*&(ing Reedus (Boondock Saints, The Walking Dead) walking down a beautifully crafted street. As in a character that looks EXACTLY like him. Oh, did I forget to mention that the graphics were incredible? Because they are, which made the whole thing even more frightening. Anyways, it ends with you finding out that Hideo Kojima (mastermind of the _INCREDIBLE_ Metal Gear series), Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy 2, and Pacific Rim) and Normal Reedus were collaborating on a new Konami game _Silent Hills_ as the latest entry in the _Silent Hill_ franchise.

So when I learned all of this glorious information, I was saddened. As much as Silent Hill 2 ruined horror games for me, and this experience was not that much better for my delicate and fragile mental disposition, I found that Konami scrapped the project. It's done. What glorious tale would have been cooked with Kojima's delicious (and ogranic!) storytelling, mixed with Guillermo's legendary craft for monster making(baking?), all with a copious seasoning of Norman Reedus' brilliant acting? Who knows. All I know is that Konami scrapped it and I'm kind of upset at them. Office politics, to be sure. Such a shame.

On the bright side, Kojima has left Konami (except for a contract to work on further Metal Gear games with them) to start his own game design shop. It has been confirmed that he and Guillermo will work on _something_. No word on whether or not Reedus will join in the fun though.

Anyways, this wraps up my LAN party game reviews and shenanigans. I will be writing more development based stuff and maybe a few other bits later on. Coming soon: A book report on Darren Hardy's _The Compound Effect_, a book that will teach you how to be successful (without all of the seminars and easy payments of $19.95), as well as a game review of Subject Matter Games' Super Wall Crash, a company owned by one of the guys from the LAN (who also introduced me to PT...I haven't forgotten the nightmares you have caused me...).

so, stay tuned and have a great Tuesday!
