# The LAN Party Tradition

As many of you are more than likely aware, I am a fairly avid gamer. For those of you who aren't, well then...Hi, I'm Colin, and I'm an avid gamer. Maybe not streaming 12 hours a day on Twitch for thousands to see avid, but generally, I'm tabletop or video gaming at least a few hours a day, several times a week. This means that aside from X Files or How I Met Your Mother or some other TV show, this is my main pass time. I'm trying to slim down on watching TV, or at least watching more educational programs, but I know that I will _never_ slim down on the amount of gaming that I do. It's just who I am. I game, and I love it.

Now that _that's_ out of the way, I am writing this article about one of my favorite traditions (while listening to an RPG gaming playlist on Spotify and yes, I know that's just so _meta_), the somewhat quarterly-ish LAN party that my friends up in the Wausau/Point/Plover area host. There's a bit of history to this LAN, most of which I have only picked up on context. Basically, there was a group of friends that played a lot of games together in their parent's basements after a long, boring day in middle school. While I was playing Super Metroid, Ocarina of Time and Pokemon, these guys were playing Goldeneye and the like. That's just who they were, they were lovers of the competitive multiplayer art form, and that lover only further increased when they started playing Halo in high school, with a slowly increasing friends group.

Over time, the group grew, their love of games grew and suddenly people were moving all over the place. Thus started the tradition, that every so often, they would come back and drink a ridiculous amount of Mountain Dew, eat Cheetos and Durritos and play games. Fast forward a few years, and I met one of the guys at work. Both of us being gamers, we became friends and eventually after our own mini-LAN's, playing World of Warcraft and Diablo, I was eventually invited to my first LAN in the somewhat northwoods. Of course, I partook in the LAN, as I am a social creature by my nature. Well, perhaps more of an ambivert, but to me, the excuse to get away from work for 3 days of frivolity, no responsibility and gaming with a group of people is simply too good to pass up.

# This Weekend's LAN

So here I am now, coming down from a Dew high after this weekend's LAN, having gotten myself one of the last few bottles of Great Northern's Distillery's surrendipitous Doppelganger Whiskey (A whiskey crafted from a botched batch of Oso Brewing's Doppelbock. No, the botched batch won't kill you, it was a taste quality test that failed. The beer was perfectly fine, and any risiduals would have been killed by being distilled into a higher proof alcohol.) This stuff has been on my mind since last May's LAN, it is honestly that delicious. Hopefully it will not just be a limited release, but currently they do not have any plans to make any more. Sad day. To top it all off, I got a chance to play more Witcher 3 (won't get too much into detail on that, if you game, you should have a good enough idea on that already), as well as to play three new games (new to me), Gang Beasts, Towerfall Ascension, and PT.

I tore into a 12 pack of Diet Mountain Dew, ate chili cheese hot dogs and burgers and chinese food and dove into some of the most fun (and frightening) gaming that I have done in an incredibly long time. Let's start with the fun:

## OMG Gang Beasts

Have you ever wished that you could play a game so violent and cartoony in nature that you felt that you were a long time customer of Acme Supplies? YES? OF COURSE YOU DO! Well, then, Gang Beasts is the game for you! This game has simplistic and cartoony 3D graphics, which allow you to play the game with little graphical distraction but with enough distinction in the characters and the environment to know what's going on. What's going on? How about rag-doll physics in a local multiplayer throwdown, reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote's antics with a feel for a not-so-secret fight club in some of the most ridiculous environments known to man? Sound pretty awesome so far? BECAUSE IT IS. IT SO IS. We were nearly hospitalized due to a lack of oxygen in our brains, we were laughing so much. You control your character's arms independently, can headbutt, jump, kick and do any combination of those moves. You can also lift stuff. So, with that, combined with rag doll physics and mostly destructible environments, you would get into incredibly hilarious throwdown situations.

### The Characters

Alright, let's start with character selection. You have some office folk, many of whom are disheveled, a trucker, a normal person, some people in animal costumes and a person in a Barney (the dinosaur) costume. You can choose several colors. Those are your options, which doesn't sound like much, but remember, you're here to knock out that a*&hole dinosaur who's been laughing at you the whole time. If you could just grab him and throw him off of--wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. The point is, you do not need much customization. Between the costumes, colors, their laughter and the way you can control their bodies, the characters are just expressive enough to do what they need to do: wreck everything in their path, and be the only one left standing in a Smash Bros-esque brawler.

### The Gameplay

Next, let's discuss the fighting physics. You can move each arm independently, for punching and grabbing. You can also jump, grab, kick and headbutt. Or, you know, all of them at once and flail all over the place like a Scottish Bezerker. The choice is yours. On top of that, you can be knocked out. If someone hits your head hard enough, or you flail and hit your own head hard enough, you will be KO'd. Which is bad. Really bad. Because each time it happens, it becomes more likely to occur. It also means you are out for like 15 seconds (unless you press all of the buttons with great fervor, then it's like 3-4 seconds), giving your opponents enough time to throw you into an area where you die and lose a life. If you lose all lives, you are out that round.

### The Environments

Lastly, let's talk about the levels in this game. Pretty much all of these places are the most incredible and ridiculous places to fight, ever, period, end of story. You have the choice of:
- Inside of a nuclear power plant turbine, which has the effect of either throwing you into the air, or pulling you toward the fan. You have a small central area and a catwalk where you can fight. That's it. Oh and the side vents? Yeah, if you get sucked into those, you lose a life. Fall into the turbine and you are most likely to die. Or just stand there, having no way to get off of the turbine, hoping that the turbine either floats you upward, to get back to safety, or pulls you down to kill you so that your suffering is over. 
- Inside of a ...something... factory. So you are in some sort of area, on a platform made of trap doors. Randomly, giant, colorful cheeto puffs fall from the ceiling, and yes, they can knock you out. Fall into the trap doors and you are out.
- At a subway station. Watch out for speeding trains!
- On the tops of two semi-trucks. You can jump between them, but if you fall off, you are out and will most likely get hit by trucks further back in the convoy.
- Inside two external elevators. You know those elevators that are on the outside of a building? Those. You can fall off and die, jump between them, or punch/headbutt the cables until they break, hoping you are holding on when you do.
- In a trash compactor facility or something like that. Basically, there are grinders everywhere and a giant gaping hole. Don't fall into the grinders or in the hole.
- On two shipping containers dangling from crane cables. Like the elevators, you can jump between them or snap the cables. Unlike the elvators, they're spinning around.
- On top of a power plant smoke stack. Don't fall off of any of the edges!
- At a large foundry styel incinerator. Don't fall into the incinerator!
- On top of a blimp! Don't fall off!
- On a small group of ice plates surrounding an ocean bouy. Remember, kids, ice water is bad!

Basically, each level is more ridiculous than the last, making you wonder why these people are fighting in such crazy locations...well, you wonder for about 5 minutes, then you just start laughing. Anyways, this game is fantastic, and is clearly worthy of your time when you have friends over. It's $20, so for a somewhat bugggy indie Steam game (unplugging/repluggging controllers will crash the game, and sometimes the character physics will freak out and your character will become a weird angular creature of mind boggling power and speed that will knock people off of the level, which is actually an awesome bug that I hope never gets fixed), you might say "No" but I urge you to reconsider, as this is just too hilarious to pass up!

# The Wrap Up (For Now)

I have a lot more to tell you, but I feel that this is a lot of content to spring on you. I am posting two more game reviews from this weekend, today, so you can read them if you would like.
