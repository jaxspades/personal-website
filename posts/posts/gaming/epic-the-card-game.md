# Gaming Night

So here it is, the first/second Wednesday of the month, where my roommate and a few of our friends gather for a monthly ritual where we eat, drink and be merry (or unmerry if you are losing), all while playing some sort of a cut-throat game, whether it be Catan, Carcassone, Power Grid, King of Tokyo or this month's main player (get used to terrible puns if you follow me), *Epic the Card Game*. In actuality, I'm sure it's just called *Epic*, but when you work with a lot of people who used to work at a massive tech company with the same name, you tend to be more specific, haha. I'm going to stop using the full name I gave it; from here on out, *Epic* is the card game. Cool? Cool.

Anyways, after pizza and beer were consumed, we began an *Epic* journey (I've lost you now, right? There's no way you're still intrigued at this point...), delving into an incredible deck-building, almost trading card-esque game, which felt a lot like a streamlined version of [Magic the Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic%3A_The_Gathering). Which brings me to:

# Nostalgic Mechanics

What I really, and I mean *really* loved about Magic, Pokemon TCG (Trading Card Game) and for an exceptionally brief time in high school, LOTR TCG, were the mechanics. You have 2 to X number of players. Each person has a life total. You want to either bring them all to 0 in a last person standing effort. Sometimes there were other win/lose conditions, but generally, that was it. From there you have creatures you can bring into play to attack or defend, you have spell cards that can be played at specific times for various effects and your creatures can sometimes use abilities of their own. That is the thousand foot view, to be sure, but that's what most of you want; why write out the rules for a summary?

Continuing, what was great about *Epic* was how  nostalgic and familiar it was. Within minutes, I understood most of the mechanics because I had seen variations of them before. What made Epic truly great, however, was that resource management was kept to a bare minimum and you didn't have to expect 17 reactions from the other player.

## Reaction Hell

For those of you unfamiliar with most TCG's, you do something, they react, you react, we all react and suddenly you have no idea what in the fruity pebbles is happening and oh my god where did 15 zombies come from? With *Epic*, if I kill your creature, you may have an event you can play, but 95% of the time, you do not. It's done. There is no "spell stack". The deed is done. At first, I was like "meh", but then I was like "Hmmm...this does speed everything up. PROCEED!"

## Why Can't I Hold All of These Lands?

As for resource management, you don't have to worry about having enough resources of a specific type to play a card. The card is 1 gold or 0 gold, and you get 1 gold on each player's turn. You cannot hoard gold; you lose it at the end of the turn. Bye-bye resource bookkeeping or getting manaf*(&ed, and hello to just playing the game like the good gamemakers intended.

# Pacing

Which leads me to my next point. Pacing. The pacing was quick, and the turn phases undeniable. You were not going to argue about whose spell did what, nor sit there for 20 minutes trying to make a play out of nothing. You knew when it was done, both the turn and the game. It was great! Now, don't get me wrong, I will always love Magic, as it is super fully featured, but this ends up making *Epic* like *Heroes of the Storm* while *Magic* is like *League of Legends* or *DotA*.

> If I lost you with that one, I apologize. I will be posting about more than just gaming, gaming references, 80's references (SOON), meme references and terrible puns...but you will have to endure that along the way.

# Conclusion

So, in the end, my impression of this game is that if you love TCG's or deckbuilders, you will love this game. If you just want to brutally crush your opponent's hopes and dreams, then you will love this game. If you're a kind hearted ne'er-do-ill (IT WORKS, TRUST ME) who hates cards, then you'll hate this game. For everyone else...I don't know what you're into, and I'm not sure that I do want to, but I'm sure that *Epic* has something for you as well.

All the points on an arbitrary rating scale, would play again.
