# Professional Life

I'm a Senior Software Engineer in Middleton doing what I love: building websites. I have used a vast array (little development pun for ya) of technologies and methodologies during my tenure as a developer, such as (but most certainly not limited to):

- HTML 4/5
- CSS 2/3
- Javascript, including ECMAScript 2015
- Angular 1.2+
- jQuery
- Oracle SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL and various implementations of NoSQL like MongoDB
- Python
- ASP.NET
- RESTful Architecture
- Microservice Architecture
- MVC Architecure
- Site deployment
- Unit Testing and E2E testing for JS applications through Karma, Mocha, Chai, Jasmine and Selenium

# Personal Life

I'm an avid gamer, and I have many hobbies from making music to cooking to doodling in my sketchbooks. I love creating anything that I can, and I have even been thinking of getting into the automated space with Raspberry PI, Arduino and Amazon Echo.

If I haven't piqued your interest in my blog by now, then I'm not sure that I ever will, haha.
